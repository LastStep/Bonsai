# Bonsai

**Scaffold Claude Code agent workspaces from the command line.**

Pick your components and Bonsai generates the full instruction layer — identity, protocols, workflows, skills, sensors, routines, and project scaffolding — all wired up and ready to go.

One binary. No runtime dependencies. Works with any project.

> [!TIP]
> **First time?** Read the **[Handbook](HANDBOOK.md)** for a deep dive into how the agent system works and how to get the best results.

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/LastStep/Bonsai@latest
```

> Requires Go 1.24+

---

## Quick Start

**1. Initialize** — set up the station (project scaffolding + Tech Lead agent):

```bash
cd your-project
bonsai init
```

This creates a `station/` directory with project management infrastructure and installs the Tech Lead agent — your project's primary agent that architects the system and dispatches work to other agents.

**2. Add code agents** — pick a type, select components, review, and generate:

```bash
bonsai add
```

**3. Repeat** for each code agent you need. That's it.

<summary><strong>Other commands</strong></summary>

```bash
bonsai list                    # see what's installed
bonsai catalog                 # browse all available abilities
bonsai catalog --agent backend # filter by agent type
bonsai remove backend          # remove agent from config
bonsai remove backend -d       # also delete generated files
```

## Agent Types

| Agent | Role | Installed via |
|:------|:-----|:-------------|
| **Tech Lead** | Architects the system, writes plans, reviews agent output — _never writes application code_ | `bonsai init` (required) |
| **Backend** | Executes backend plans — API, database, server-side logic | `bonsai add` |
| **Frontend** | Executes frontend plans — UI components, state management, styling | `bonsai add` |
| **Full-Stack** | Implements features end-to-end — UI, API routes, database, auth, tests | `bonsai add` |
| **DevOps** | Manages infrastructure-as-code, CI/CD pipelines, containers, deployment | `bonsai add` |
| **Security** | Audits code for vulnerabilities, reviews auth patterns, scans dependencies | `bonsai add` |

> Tech Lead is always installed first. You talk to the Tech Lead; it dispatches work to code agents. You can still work directly with code agents for quick fixes.

## Catalog

Every component is mix-and-match. Bonsai filters by agent compatibility automatically.

| Category | What it is | Examples |
|:---------|:----------|:---------|
| **Skills** | Domain knowledge and standards | `coding-standards` `testing` `database-conventions` `api-design-standards` `auth-patterns` `design-guide` |
| **Workflows** | Step-by-step task procedures | `planning` `plan-execution` `code-review` `reporting` `security-audit` `session-logging` |
| **Protocols** | Hard rules, enforced every session | `session-start` `security` `scope-boundaries` `memory` |
| **Sensors** | Auto-enforced hooks on Claude Code events | `session-context` `scope-guard-files` `dispatch-guard` `api-security-check` `test-integrity-guard` |
| **Routines** | Periodic self-maintenance tasks (Tech Lead only) | `dependency-audit` `vulnerability-scan` `doc-freshness-check` `status-hygiene` |

> Run `bonsai catalog` to see the full list with descriptions, agent compatibility, and frequencies.
